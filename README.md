# defmain

A Clojure library designed to make main entry points easy.

Code shamelessly pulled from [cascalog core](http://nathanmarz.github.io/cascalog/cascalog.api.html#var-defmain). This is just meant to be a version with a much lighter dependecy footprint.

## Usage

Add these entries to your `project.clj`:

```clj
  :dependencies [[net.drib/defmain "0.1.0"]]
  :aot [my.ns]
```

then add this to your code

```clj
(defmain hello
  [greetee]
  (println (str "Hello " greetee "!")))
```

and run via lein or java

```
$ lein run -m my.ns.hello world
Hello world!
$ java -cp target/my-uberjar.jar my.ns.hello world
Hello world!
```
